This is the link to my assignment which is hosted on AWS

https://shraddha2104.github.io/Coding-Assesment/

I have developed my frontend using JS, HTML, CSS.

Files->
loadData.php= database of questions
index.html= home page



I have assumed two things in the assignment->

1) Every test in each category consists of 10 questions with max score being equal to 10 each. The total duration of test is 10 mins.

2) The Full test tab is treated as a real test which a user has to complete in the same session. So every time a full test tab is clicked it is treated as a new session.

Features->
1) User can see historical scores of himself as well as other users too to get a comprehensive performance as compared to other students as a list.

2) performance.html shows the data visualization for the user's score to know where does he stand. The graph can also be exported as csv, png and jpeg formats.


Future work->
The scope of the project can be extended by-
1) Students can also published their scores on social media platforms- Facebook, Instagram and Twitter using their respective APIs.

2) Also the parameter given in the database 'chosen_percentage' can be utlized to shuffle the questions set based on the probability given to each question.

3) Strengths and Weaknesses can also be determined by doing data exploration on scores in different categories.

4) User can create his own quiz by dyamically choosing the number of questions he wants.
